An interactive rating component, built using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Challenge by Frontend Mentor.

What I learned:

- Reminded myself how the DOM works and how Javascript can be used to manipulate HTML elements.
- Practiced CSS Flexbox.
- Learned how to toggle the appearance and disappearance of elements using event listeners.
- Successfully implemented a feature that captures the user's rating based on their button selection and displays that rating once the submit button is clicked.
- Added a "Rate again" button to reset the page and allow the user to submit another rating.
